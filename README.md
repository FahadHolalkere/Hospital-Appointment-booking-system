# Hospital Appointment Booking System

This platform is a robust web-based application designed to streamline the process of booking appointments at local hospitals.

The front-end of the website is built using Node.js and Express.js, two powerful JavaScript frameworks known for their speed and flexibility. These technologies enable the creation of a dynamic, interactive user interface that is both intuitive and user-friendly.

On the back-end, the website utilizes MongoDB, a document-oriented database program, in conjunction with Mongoose, an elegant MongoDB object modeling tool. This combination allows for efficient data management and retrieval, ensuring the reliability and integrity of the user data.
